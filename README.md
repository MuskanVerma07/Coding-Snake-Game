# Snake Game

Welcome to the **Snake Game** project! This is a classic arcade-style game where you control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, but you must avoid colliding with walls and the snake's own body. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by collecting food while navigating the game area.

 Features
- Simple Gameplay: Easy to learn but challenging to master.
- Dynamic Difficulty: The speed of the snake increases as you progress.
- Score Tracking: Keeps track of your score as you play.
- Game Over Screen: Displays your final score when the game ends.

 Technologies Used
- Programming Language**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right
2. Eat the food (usually represented by a colored dot or square) to grow the snake.
3. Avoid running into the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area.


 Roadmap
Here are some features we plan to add in future updates:
- Obstacles in the game area.
- Multiple levels with varying difficulty.
- Multiplayer mode.
- Enhanced graphics and animations.


Enjoy the game and have fun coding! ðŸ˜Š
